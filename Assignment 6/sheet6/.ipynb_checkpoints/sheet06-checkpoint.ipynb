    "# Weighted K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will simulate finding good locations for production plants of a company in order to minimize its logistical costs. In particular, we would like to place production plants near customers so as to reduce shipping costs and delivery time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the probability of someone being a customer is independent of its geographical location and that the overall cost of delivering products to customers is proportional to the squared Euclidean distance to the closest production plant. Under these assumptions, the K-Means algorithm is an appropriate method to find a good set of locations. Indeed, K-Means finds a spatial clustering of potential customers and the centroid of each cluster can be chosen to be the location of the plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are potentially millions of customers, and that it is not scalable to model each customer as a data point in the K-Means procedure, we consider instead as many points as there are geographical locations, and assign to each geographical location a weight $w_i$ corresponding to the number of inhabitants at that location. The resulting problem becomes a weighted version of K-Means where we seek to minimize the objective:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_k$ is the $k$th centroid, and $w_i$ is the weight of each geographical coordinate $x_i$. In order to minimize this cost function, we iteratively perform the following EM computations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expectation step:** Compute the set of points associated to each centroid:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall~1 \\leq k \\leq K: \\quad \\mathcal{C}(k) \\leftarrow \\Big\\{ i ~:~ k = \\mathrm{arg}\\min_k \\| x_i - c_k \\|^2 \\Big\\}\n",
